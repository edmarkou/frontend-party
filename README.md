# Tesonet FrontEnd developer task

## Couple of notes

# Design

- Never got to totally change the scrollbar, so it is pretty sloppy.
- Was very nice to use some SVG's again!
- I mostly touch upon SCSS, but used plain simple CSS, because I am most comfortable with it (old habits).

# App

- Loved every task I had from here!

# Bonus

- First time setting up webpack from scratch.
- Learned some new stuff, so I had a lot of fun!
